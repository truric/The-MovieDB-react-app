# React application: The-Movie-Database Rest API

## About
The following repo contains a React application which consumes a REST API.

## I've learned:
* how to store any variable on .env and call them as process.env.REACT_APP_VARIABLE without them being shown to the public
* React hooks
* to use fetch instead of axios
* the need for an empty component ( <> )
* JSX convention
* the need of ternary operator to/not display an image or show a piece of code when API calls may fail when discontinued
